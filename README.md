# Project 2: A Real Estate Web Application

(THIS IS A WORKING DRAFT)

One of the hallmarks of the UCI Bootcamp is the opportunity it gives its students to plan and work on a web application in groups. This highlights the concepts and tools we have added to our growing arsenal of computer frameworks, languages, and technologies that will make us more employable, as well as showcase our ability to take on real projects, work with other developers, and simulate workplace situations and challenges. 

## Project 2

Since projects play a key role in our journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, Project 2 aims for us, as we enter the last phase of the boot camp and apply for jobs, to show would-be employers our collaborative skills and coding abilities through our portfolio, which will have our deployed Project 2 web application as its focal point.

At the beginning of Project 2, we are assigned to our respective teams, and with our team, we are tasked to conceive and execute a design with the following parameters in mind:

* We will use everything that we have learned over the past six units to create a real-world full-stack application that we will be able to showcase to potential employers.

* In creating our first collaborative full-stack application, we will combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authenticationâ€”-to an intuitive front end. 

* We will continue to build on the agile development methodologies we have used used throughout the course, like storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

* Instead of using the front end we developed for our first project, we will start from scratch. Doing so will help us reinforce our existing front-end abilities and solidify our understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end. Also, this will likely improve our skills since that first project, so with a stronger foundation now we can build a better application, using all of the additional practice we have had in the last several weeks.

## User Story

```
AS A person who is looking to buy his or her first home, refinance a present real estate property, or look for a possible property investment, 

THE USER WANTS a web application that will allow him or her to enter basic personal information as a pre-requisite to filing an application to purchase or refinance a home or property
